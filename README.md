# Grep_Project

This is my Grep Project where I was given the ED code and my task was able to compress about 1700 lines of code down to about 
400 lines of code. I had to cut out various amount of code that was unnecessary while at the same time retain its function.
I was wasn't able to change the main function where it accepted arguments as:
    ./grep 'If' spectre.txt     NOTE: spectre.txt is the file I used to test it
  
The way to run this c file is the same way to be able to run the orignal ed code supplied to us at the start of the project:
    ./grep spectre.txt
    g/blood
    I want to feel love, run through my blood
