# Grep_Project

This is my Grep Project where I was given the ED code and my task was able to compress about 1700 lines of code down to about 
400 lines of code. I had to cut out various amount of code that was unnecessary while at the same time retain its function.
I was wasn't able to change the main function where it accepted arguments as:<br/>
    ./grep 'If' spectre.txt    <br/> NOTE: spectre.txt is the file I used to test it <br/>
  
The way to run this c file is the same way to be able to run the orignal ed code supplied to us at the start of the project:<br/>
     ./grep spectre.txt<br/>
     g/blood<br/>
     I want to feel love, run through my blood
